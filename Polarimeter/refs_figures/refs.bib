abstract = {The first three columns of the instrument matrix A of the four-detector photopolarimeter (FDP) are determined by Fourier analysis of the output current vector I(P) as a function of the azimuth angle P of the incident linearly polarized light. Therefore 12 of the 16 elements of A are measured free of the imperfections of the (absent) quarter-wave retarder (QWR). The effect of angular beam deviation by the polarizer is compensated for by taking the average, (1/2) \[I(P) $+$ I(P $+$ 180{\textdegree})\], of the FDP output at 180{\textdegree}-apart, optically equivalent, angular positions of the polarizer. The remaining fourth column of A is determined by the FDP's response to the right- and left-handed circular polarization states. Because these states are impossible to generate with an imperfect QWR, a novel procedure is developed. In particular, the response of the FDP to the unattainable right- or left-handed circular polarization state is found by taking the average of the responses of the FDP to an elliptical near-circular state and that state rotated in azimuth by 90{\textdegree}. This calibration scheme is applied to measure A of our prototype FDP of four Si detectors at $\lambda$ $=$ 632.8 nm. A is determined, in external and internal reference frames, free of imperfections in the polarizing optical elements. The FDP, with its uncontaminated A matrix, is used subsequently to evaluate the imperfections of the QWR with the help of an appropriate model.},

abstract = {A real-time polarization control system employing two non-orthogonal reference signals multiplexed in either time or wavelength with the data signal is presented. It is shown, theoretically and experimentally, that complete control of multiple polarization states can be attained employing polarization controllers in closed-loop configuration. Experimental results on the wavelength multiplexing setup show that negligible added penalties, corresponding to an average added optical Quantum Bit Error Rate of 0.044\%, can be achieved with response times smaller than 10 ms, without significant introduction of noise counts in the quantum channel.},
